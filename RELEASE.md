# Release handling

Once target functionality has been completed and verified...

1. The `VERSION` variable in `setup.py` is changed to the target new semantic
   version.
2. The change is committed and pushed to `master`.
3. `python setup.py upload` is run, which makes the new package version
   available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/rabbitmq-client/).
4. Create a new release: [GitHub releases](https://github.com/maansthoernvik/rabbitmq_client/releases/new)
