        General consumer interface, when wanting to consumer messages sent to a
        specific queue or exchange. Input parameters are a subset of those used
        by pika, to avoid re-inventing the wheel with special abstractions.
        The only parameters that have been removed are the "passive" and
        "callback" options.

        Some restrictions apply:
        1. EITHER queue OR exchange OR both MUST be set.
        2. Queue/exchange parameter change is not supported. For example, this
           consumer will not handle a re-declaration of a queue with new
           provided parameters.

        RMQConsumer will automatically re-issue queue and exchange declarations
        and bindings if the connection is for some reason closed and re-opened
        at any point.

        This method may be called before the underlying RMQConnection has
        successfully established a connection and channel to RabbitMQ. Those
        buffered actions called before RMQConnection reports it is ready,
        through the 'on_ready' hook, will be issued immediately upon 'on_ready'
        being called. Monitor the RMQConsumer 'ready' property to keep track of
